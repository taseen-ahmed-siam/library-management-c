# Library Management System in C – File Based Console Application

## 📖 Description

This is a **fully functional Library Management System written in C**, designed for beginners and intermediate programmers to practice **file handling, structures, and console-based application design**.  

The program allows users to **add, display, search, update, and delete books**, and it saves all book data permanently in a file (`library.dat`), so your data persists even after closing the program.  

It features a **clean, menu-driven interface** with ASCII formatting and colored text (for Windows), making the console interface **easy to read and visually appealing**. The code is modular, well-structured, and easy to expand, making it a great learning resource for anyone exploring **C programming, file I/O, and system programming concepts**.
